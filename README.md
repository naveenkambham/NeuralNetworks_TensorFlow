# NeuralNetworks_TensorFlow
This project contains the code to Create Neural Networks model using Keras wrappers. Also demonstrated that tuning Hyperparameters can be done manually. Code to Hypertune using Scikit Gridsearchcv method is also presented. Models are evaluated using Cross validation and Root Mean Square Error as metric. Fit lines for actual values and predicted values are plotted to get the insights about the model
