## Neural Networks 
This project contains the code to create neural networks model using Keras wrappers. Code demonstrates tuning hyperparameters manually and also using scikit gridsearchcv method. Models are evaluated using cross validation and root mean square error as metric. Fit lines for actual values and predicted values are plotted to get the insights about the model
